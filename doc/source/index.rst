Pylene : a modern C++ image processing library
==============================================

|Pylene| is an open-source image processing library that aims at proving a generic framework to develop IP algorithms
with safety, simplicity and performance in Mind. It is originated from Milena_ with the following objectives:


* Simplicity: simple modern C++ syntax with Python binding (in development) 
* Efficiency: write algorithms in a simple way and run them as if they were written in C .We follow one guideline: zero-cost abstraction.
* Genericity: write algorithms that are able to run on many kind of images with, yet, zero-cost abstraction.
* Interoperability: run algorithms on image coming from and to external libraries (even on your own image type).

|Pylene| features ready-to-use image data structures (regular 2D, 3D images) and focus (but is not limited to
Mathematical Morphology Operators).
