    Image{I} image_concrete_t<I> fill_hole(I f, Neighborhood nbh, image_point_t<I> marker)
    Image{I} void fill_hole(I f, Neighborhood nbh, image_point_t<I> marker, Image out)
 
    The holes of a binary image correspond to the set of its regional minima which
    are not connected to the image border (or a given `marker`). It is defined as the complement
    of the background connected component of the marker.

        E \setminus CC(p)


    :param f: Input image ùëì of type bool.
    :param nbh:  Elementary structuring element.
    :param marker: Reference point for background
 
    :return: A binary image whose type is deduced from the input image
 
    :exception: N/A
